My name is Tess Kern, and I am majoring in agronomy. Agronomy is the study of plants and soil. 
I've been watching a lot of lectures for my ochem class, as well as doing a lot of study problems for the class. 
My roommates and I have started to rewatch pretty little liars, so that has been fun. 
I have been attending weekly power barre classes, and I enjoy how it challenges me. 
I use a planner and put everyhting I need to get done in a day in there. Writing down what I need to do helps me stay organized and remember what needs to get done. 
I also utilize breaks very frequently whenever I study. I notice that taking breaks helps me not get burned out
Having study groups with people from my classes helps me stay organized and keep on track.
